An alias is a command-line shortcut. Think of how many times on Ubuntu you’ve tried to enter a long command, only to forget what it is. An alias can be set up as a shortcut to that long command, so you don’t have to remember it.

Aliases are configured in the ~/.bashrc file in your Ubuntu home folder. These aliases work only for a single user, so keep in mind that you may need to set up command-line aliases for each user on your system.

### Example of creating an alias
```alias c="clear"```

```alias ls="rm *"``` Create a script that creates an alias. Name: ls Value: rm *
