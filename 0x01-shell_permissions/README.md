## chmod
The chmod command is used to change the permissions of a file or directory.

```
rwx rwx rwx = 111 111 111
rw- rw- rw- = 110 110 110
rwx --- --- = 111 000 000

rwx = 111 in binary = 7
rw- = 110 in binary = 6
r-x = 101 in binary = 5
r-- = 100 in binary = 4
-w- = 010 in binary = 2
--x = 001 in binary = 1

```

```
u+x = Add execute permission for the owner.
u-x  = Remove execute permission from the owner.
+x = Add execute permission for the owner, group, and world. This is equivalent to a+x.
o-rw = Remove the read and write permissions from anyone besides the owner and group owner.
go=rw = Set the group owner and anyone besides the owner to have read and write permission. If either the group owner or the world previously had execute permission, it is removed.
u+x,go=rx  = Add execute permission for the owner and set the permissions for the group and others to read and execute. Multiple specifications may be separated by commas.
```

For example, if we wanted to set some_file to have read and write permission for the owner, but wanted to keep the file private from others, we would:
```
root@/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x01-shell_permissions# chmod 600 some_file

```
## Changing File Ownership
We can change the owner of a file by using the chown command. Here's an example: Suppose we wanted to change the owner of some_file from "me" to "you". We could:

```[me@linuxbox me]$ sudo chown you some_file```

## Changing Group Ownership
The group ownership of a file or directory may be changed with chgrp. This command is used like this:

```[me@linuxbox me]$ chgrp new_group some_file```
